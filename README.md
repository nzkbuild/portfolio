# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site. I'm Nabil, an early-career developer with a background in HR and operations. I build tools that solve real problems I've seen firsthand.

## About Me

I didn't come from a computer science path. I studied Human Resource Management and will graduate in December 2025. My coding journey started with trading automation in early 2025, then shifted to web development when I joined a public-sector organisation through a Protégé program in August 2025.

Working frontline showed me how much time gets lost when information lives in different places. When my supervisor asked if I could build a better tracking system, I started KIOS - an internal operations tool that's still in active development.

I'm not trying to chase hype. I just want to build things that genuinely help people do their jobs better.

## Projects

### KIOS (Internal Operations System)
A tool to organise staff roles, appointments and outreach activities. Built to replace multiple spreadsheets and help the team work with clearer information.

- Custom PIN login for staff
- Role-based views for management and frontline teams
- Centralised tables for daily operations
- Built through continuous feedback from the people who use it

**Tech**: Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel

### Support and Resistance X (SNRX)
My entry point into coding. An automated trading system built in MQL4 and MQL5. I wanted a rule-based system that removed emotion from my decisions as a beginner trader.

- Deployed on VPS or RDP
- Executes predefined trading logic on MT4 and MT5
- Backtested and forward tested
- Helped me learn discipline, patterns and clean logic

**Tech**: MQL4, MQL5, MetaTrader, VPS/RDP

### Trading Automation Lab
A hands-on sandbox where I learned how different systems pass data, trigger actions and talk through APIs.

- Grid trading prototype for Luno Malaysia
- Telegram bot for sending trade alerts
- Python to MT4 and MT5 execution bridge
- Focused on data flow, timing and integration

**Tech**: Python, REST APIs, Luno API, Telegram Bot API

## Tech Stack (This Portfolio)

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel

## My Current Stack

- Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- React Basics, Git & GitHub, Vercel
- Python Basics, MQL4/MQL5
- Cursor and VS Code for development

## AI in My Workflow

I use AI tools to speed up learning and prototyping:
- Claude for logic breakdowns
- ChatGPT for structure and planning
- Gemini for UI ideas and layout thinking

I use them the same way I use any other tool. Understand the problem faster, build with fewer mistakes.

## Running Locally
